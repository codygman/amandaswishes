		"Hunter Boyd-Layland, a 15-year-old freshman at Cleburne High School, will be granted a wish he has needed for nearly his whole life: hearing.

		When he was about 18 months old, he was run over by a vehicle and has faced plastic surgery and difficulties hearing out of his right ear, he said.

		When Donna Goodman, founder and director of Amanda’s Wishes, a charitable organization, heard about the boy and his need for a hearing aid, she knew she wanted to help.

		“Someone mentioned that he desperately needs a hearing aid,” Goodman said. “Dr. [Ted] Benke was generous enough to donate the $3,000 hearing aid, and I am helping by paying the difference left for the fitting and insurance.”
