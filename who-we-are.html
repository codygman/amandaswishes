		<body>Amanda's Wishes is a 501(c)3 certified charity that was founded in 2007 by mother-and-daughter duo Amanda and Donna Goodman. Amanda has struggled with heart problems and numerous health problems for over 20 years, and had her wish granted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The trip inspired her, and she started Amanda's Wishes with her mom to give back and help kids with life-threatnening illnesses as well as kids in crisis.
